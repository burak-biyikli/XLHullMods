## Summary  

Mod for starsector that adds additional hull mods to the game. These hull mods come in three flavors:

1. Classic hullmods, some benifit for some OP
2. Specalized hullmods, some benifit for some cost
3. Streamline hullmods, some OP for some cost

Currently all additional hull mods are immediately known instead of being seeded into the world.

## Install  

Same as for any starsector mod. You can simply download by clicking [Here](https://github.com/burak-biyikli/XLHullMods/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), then extract the zip file into:
```
Fractal Softworks\Starsector\mods\XLHullMods
```
You will have to rename the folder from ```XLHullMods-main``` to ```XLHullMods```. The -main is added automatically by git to designate the branch downloaded but does not match the description.

Up To Date as of Feb 2025.
